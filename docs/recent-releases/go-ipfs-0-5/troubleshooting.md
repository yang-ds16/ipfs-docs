# Troubleshooting

## Dropped connections

If you are running an IPFS node prior to version `0.4.20` you need to upgrade. These nodes will be unstable and cause performance issues for the network. Please [update to IPFS 0.5](update-procedure) as soon as possible!

## IPFS/Libp2p address format changes

If you were using a multiaddr library (go, js, etc.) to name files because `/ipfs/QmSomePeerID` looks like `/ipfs/QmSomeFile`, your tool may break if you upgrade this library. If you're manually parsing multiaddrs and are searching for the string `/ipfs/...` , you'll need to search for `/p2p/...`.

## Curl requests failing

The gateway will redirect from `http://localhost:5001/ipfs/CID/...` to `http://CID.ipfs.localhost:5001/...` by default. Curl doesn't follow redirects by default. To avoid breaking cURL and other clients that don't support redirects, Go-IPFS will return the requested file along with the redirect. Browsers will follow the redirect and abort the download while cURL will ignore the redirect and finish the download.

## Minimum RSA key size

IPFS now enforces a minimum key size of 2048. IPFS generates 2048 bit RSA keys by default so this shouldn't be an issue for most people. However, users who explicitly chose a smaller key size will not be able to communicate with new nodes.

## Unable to read datastore from JS-IPFS

JS-IPFS nodes will no longer be able to read Go-ipfs datastores. Avoid pointing two nodes at the same datastore. If your Go-IPFS node reads a JS-IPFS datastore it will upgrade it and no longer be compatible with JS-IPFS.

## Using IPFS as a library

You will need to upgrade to the new interfaces for IPFS to connect to your various APIs.

## IPFS-lite not running

IPFS-lite needs to be updated to the latest 0.5 features.

## QUIC protocol

If you have enabled the QUIC experiment and are trying to connect to new nodes, it wonâ€™t work. This is the final breaking change before QUIC is stabilized and becomes the default.
